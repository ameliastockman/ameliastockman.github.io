    <div class="transcript"> 
    Okay. <div class="greeting"></div>
    <BR></BR>
    Fellow Victorians, firstly, my thanks to everyone who has come forward to get tested in the last 24 hours. A reminder, that if you’ve got symptoms &#8212 a cough, <div class="insert blank1"></div> throat, difficulty with <div class="insert blank2"></div>, loss of or abnormal <div class="insert blank3"></div> &#8212 however mild. Please get tested today. Not tomorrow. Today. It’s the single most important thing you can do.
    <BR></BR>
    Following the health advice provided this morning, Victoria will re-enter lockdown due to increasing case numbers of the <div class="insert blank4"></div> strain. This is not an easy decision, but it’s the right decision. This is not about doing what is popular, it’s about doing what needs to be done to stop the spread of this virus, in order to keep all <div class="insert blank5"></div> and <div class="insert blank6"></div> safe. 
    <BR></BR>
    Starting tonight at 6pm, and for the next two weeks, there will be 5 reasons to leave home in Victoria:
    <BR></BR>
    Shopping for essential <div class="insert blank7"></div> <div class="insert blank8"></div> and <div class="insert blank9"></div>. 
    Caregiving or compassionate reasons, including necessary <div class="insert blank10"></div> or to receive medical care. 
    In-person essential <div class="insert blank11"></div> (with a permit).
    1 hour of <div class="insert blank12"></div> outdoors, per day, either alone or with members of your household. 
    And to receive the <div class="insert blank13"></div> Vaccine.
    <BR></BR>
    We’ve done this before, and we will do it again. 
    <BR></BR>
    Let me be perfectly clear, <div class="insert blank14"></div> will not be tolerated. The <div class="insert blank4"></div> strain doesn’t care if you are feeling like <div class="insert blank15"></div> at home. Or that you want to <div class="insert blank16"></div> with your <div class="insert blank17"></div>. If we had other options, we would of course use them. But this is the only option. 
    <BR></BR>
    The majority of Victorians are doing the right thing, and I applaud them for their hard work. As a father and a <div class="insert blank18"></div> myself, I know just how difficult this is. We will all be <div class="insert blank19"></div> with our <div class="insert blank20"></div> soon. But only if we act hard and fast now. 
    <BR></BR>
    I just say to people, a sneaky and illegal visit to <div class="insert blank21"></div> is not worth it. I appeal to every Victorian. Please do the right thing, stay home and count your <div class="insert blank22"></div> to keep everyone safe. We must beat this virus together. And we can beat this virus together. 
    <BR></BR>
    Any questions before I invite Brett up to share details on today's cases?
